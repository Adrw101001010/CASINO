"""
Quick Explanation of code:
The following is a program that works as a casino with two games, BlackJack and Roulette.

For Roulette, you choose a number between 1‚Äì36, and keep spinning until you hit the number.
Once you hit, you get a return of 35X the bet amount. But every spin costs you, and if you 
run out of money you must leave.

BlackJack has more rules:
You are dealt two cards, and the dealer also gets two (one hidden). You choose to either 
'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (end your turn). If your total exceeds 21, you bust 
and lose. The dealer then reveals their second card and must keep hitting until they reach 
at least 17. If the dealer busts, you win. If not, whoever has the higher total wins. A draw 
returns your bet. You can't bet more than your balance, and winnings are added accordingly.

For the slot, if you get three randomly selected symbols in a row, you earn a profit of one divided by the probability of the event.

For all games, your winnins/losses and remaining balance are tracked. You can leave with profit, or leave when you're broke.
Good luck, and have fun!
